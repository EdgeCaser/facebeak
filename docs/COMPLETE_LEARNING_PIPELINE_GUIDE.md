## üíª Command-Line Pipeline

*For users comfortable with typing commands*

### Phase 1: Data Extraction and Preparation

#### Step 1: Extract Training Data from Videos
The primary script for this is `utilities/extract_training_data.py`. While a GUI like `extract_training_gui.py` might exist as a wrapper, the core logic relies on the command-line tool.
Example command:
```bash
# Extract crow images from your video files
python utilities/extract_training_data.py "path/to/your/video_directory" --output-dir "crow_crops" --min-confidence 0.3 --frame-batch-size 16 --target-fps 10 --enable-audio --correct-orientation
```

**What this does:**
- Scans videos in your `video_directory` for crow detections.
- **Crop Storage**: Saves one crop image per *detected bounding box*. This means if multiple crows are detected in a single frame, multiple crop images will be saved.
- **Directory Structure**: Organizes extracted crops primarily by video source:
    - `crow_crops/videos/VIDEO_NAME/frame_XXXXXX_crop_XXX.jpg`
- **Metadata File**: Creates `crow_crops/metadata/crop_metadata.json`. This crucial file maps each crop image (e.g., `videos/VIDEO_NAME/frame_XXXXXX_crop_XXX.jpg`) to its assigned `crow_id`, the original video name, frame number, and other detection details. This file is essential for linking crops back to individual identities and their context.
- Extracts synchronized audio segments (if `--enable-audio` is used and audio is available).
- Applies automatic orientation correction if `--correct-orientation` is used.
- The `CrowTracker` module, used internally, manages crow identities and decides when to assign new IDs or match existing ones.

**Command-Line Arguments for `extract_training_data.py`:**
- `video_dir`: Path to the directory containing your video files.
- `--output-dir`: The base directory where the `crow_crops` structure (including `videos/` and `metadata/`) will be created. This directory becomes the `base_dir` for subsequent training and evaluation steps. (Default: `crow_crops`)
- `--min-confidence`: Minimum detection score to consider a detection valid. (Default: 0.2)
- `--frame-batch-size`: Number of frames to process in a batch for detection. (Default: 16, adjust based on GPU memory)
- `--target-fps`: Target frames per second to process. The script will skip frames to approximate this rate. (Default: None, process all frames subject to `--frame-skip`)
- `--frame-skip`: Number of frames to skip between processed frames if `--target-fps` is not set. (Default: 0)
- `--enable-audio`: If specified, attempts to extract audio segments corresponding to detections.
- `--correct-orientation`: If specified, attempts to auto-correct the orientation of crow crops.

**Expected time:** 30-60 minutes per hour of video, depending on settings and hardware.

#### Step 2: Review and Clean Data
```bash
# Launch image reviewer to clean up false detections and label data
python image_reviewer.py --base-dir crow_crops
# (Assuming image_reviewer.py is updated or adapted to use the new structure and DB labels)
```

**What to do:**
- **Multi-Crop Awareness**: You might encounter multiple distinct crop images extracted from the same original video frame if multiple crows were detected. Review each crop independently.
- Press `1` for "This is a crow" (good quality, single crow)
- Press `2` for "This is NOT a crow" 
- Press `3` for "Unsure"
- Press `4` for "Multiple crows in image" (label as 'multi_crow')
- Press `5` for "Bad crow image" (e.g., blurry, partial, label as 'bad_crow')
- Press `q` to quit and save progress.
- **Labeling Importance**: Accurately labeling images is crucial. Images labeled as 'multi_crow', 'not_a_crow', or 'bad_crow' in the database will be automatically excluded from the training dataset by the `ImprovedCrowTripletDataset` loader.

**Expected time:** 15-30 minutes for 1000 images.

#### Step 3: Setup Training Configuration
```bash
# Analyze your dataset and create optimal training settings
python utilities/setup_improved_training.py --base-dir crow_crops
```

**What this does:**
- Analyzes your crow image collection using `crop_metadata.json` and database labels to consider only valid training images.
- Determines optimal training parameters based on the filtered dataset.
- Creates `training_config.json` with recommended settings. This configuration file will use `base_dir` (e.g., "crow_crops") to specify the root data directory.
- Provides training time estimates.

### Phase 2: Model Training

#### Step 4: Train the Crow Identification Model
```bash
# Start the main training process
python train_improved.py --config training_config.json
```

**What this does:**
- Trains a neural network to recognize individual crows using `ImprovedCrowTripletDataset`.
- **Dataset Source**: The `ImprovedCrowTripletDataset` loads images based on the `crop_metadata.json` file (found within the `base_dir` specified in the config) and reads the actual image files from the `crow_crops/videos/` subdirectories.
- **Filtering**: The dataset loader automatically filters out images that are labeled in the database as 'multi_crow', 'not_a_crow', or 'bad_crow', ensuring only clean data is used for training.
- Uses triplet loss to learn visual similarities and differences.
- Saves progress checkpoints (e.g., every 10 epochs, configurable).
- Creates visualizations of training progress.

**Expected time:** 
- **With GPU:** 8-12 hours for 100 epochs (varies greatly with dataset size and GPU model).
- **CPU only:** 48-72+ hours for 100 epochs.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** Don't close the command window during training!

#### Step 5: Monitor Training Progress
Open a new command window and run:
```bash
# Check training logs (path might be inside a timestamped run folder within your base_output_dir from config)
tail -f training_output/your_model_timestamp/training.log

# Or view progress plots (updates as configured)
# Example: python -c "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt; import json;
# with open('training_output/your_model_timestamp/metrics_history.json') as f:
#    data = json.load(f);
# plt.plot(data['train_loss']);
# plt.title('Training Loss');
# plt.show()"
```
*(Adjust paths to `metrics_history.json` based on your actual output directory structure defined in `training_config.json`)*

### Phase 3: Model Validation and Testing

#### Step 6: Evaluate Model Performance
Update the command to use `--base-dir` and new threshold arguments:
```bash
# Test the trained model
python utilities/simple_evaluate.py --model-path training_output/your_model_timestamp/best_model.pth --base-dir crow_crops --id-similarity-threshold 0.5 --non-crow-similarity-threshold 0.4
```

**What this shows:**
The evaluation script has been enhanced:
- **Data Loading**: It now also uses `crop_metadata.json` and database labels (from the specified `base_dir`) to load appropriate samples, including images labeled as 'not_a_crow' for comprehensive testing.
- **Crow Identification Metrics**:
    - Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Accuracy for distinguishing between *known crow IDs*.
    - Average similarity for same-crow pairs and different-crow pairs.
    - Separability score for known crow IDs.
- **Crow vs. Non-Crow Distinction Metrics (New)**:
    - `non_crow_true_rejection_rate`: How often 'not_a_crow' images are correctly identified as not matching any known crow below the `--non-crow-similarity-threshold`.
    - `non_crow_false_alarm_rate`: How often 'not_a_crow' images are mistakenly matched to a known crow above the `--non-crow-similarity-threshold`.
- The thresholds used for both types of evaluations are reported.

**Command-Line Arguments for `simple_evaluate.py`:**
- `--model-path`: Path to your trained model file (e.g., `best_model.pth` or a specific checkpoint).
- `--base-dir`: The root directory containing the `crow_crops` structure (especially `metadata/crop_metadata.json` and the `videos/` image folders).
- `--id-similarity-threshold`: Cosine similarity threshold for considering two known crow images as a match. (Default: 0.5)
- `--non-crow-similarity-threshold`: Cosine similarity threshold for deciding if a 'not_a_crow' image is distinct enough from all known crows. (Default: 0.4)
- `--max-crows`: Maximum number of unique crow individuals to sample for evaluation.
- `--max-samples-per-crow`: Maximum image samples per crow individual.

#### Step 7: Advanced Analysis (Optional)
```bash
# Run clustering analysis to find potential issues
python crow_clustering.py

# Launch suspect lineup for manual verification
python suspect_lineup.py

# Run unsupervised learning improvements
python unsupervised_workflow.py
```

### Phase 4: Deploy and Test

#### Step 8: Test on New Videos
```bash
# Process a new video with your trained model
python main.py --video "path/to/your/video.mp4" \
               --skip-output "output_skip.mp4" \
               --full-output "output_full.mp4" \
               --detection-threshold 0.3 \
               --preserve-audio
```

**What this creates:**
- `output_skip.mp4`: Video with detections on processed frames
- `output_full.mp4`: Full video with interpolated tracking
- Database entries for all detected crows

## üñ±Ô∏è GUI Pipeline (Recommended for Beginners)

*Point-and-click interface for all operations*

### Phase 1: Launch the Main Interface

#### Step 1: Start the GUI
```bash
python facebeak.py
```

**This opens the main Facebeak window with all tools.**

### Phase 2: Data Extraction

#### Step 2: Extract Training Data
1.  **In the Facebeak GUI (if it wraps `extract_training_data.py`):**
    *   Look for options to set the source video directory and the main output directory (this will be your `base_dir`, e.g., `crow_crops`).
    *   Configure parameters like detection confidence, target FPS, audio extraction, and orientation correction as available.
    *   Start the extraction.
    *   **Output**: The process will create the `crow_crops/videos/VIDEO_NAME/...` structure and `crow_crops/metadata/crop_metadata.json` as described in the command-line section.

2.  **If using `extract_training_gui.py` directly (assuming it's updated or a wrapper):**
    *   The GUI should allow specifying the video source and the main output directory (which becomes `base_dir`).
    *   It should reflect new parameters like target FPS, frame batch size, etc.
    *   **Crop Storage & Metadata**: Understand that it saves one crop per detection and creates the `crop_metadata.json` file.

3. **Wait for completion:**
   - Progress bar shows current status
   - Output window shows detailed progress
   - **Don't close the window during extraction**

**Expected time:** 30-60 minutes per hour of video

### Phase 3: Data Quality Control

#### Step 3: Review Extracted Images
1.  **From main Facebeak GUI (or by running `python image_reviewer.py --base-dir crow_crops`):**
    *   Launch the Image Reviewer. Ensure it's configured to use the database for storing labels.
2.  **In the Image Reviewer:**
    *   **Multi-Crop Awareness**: Remember that you might be reviewing multiple crops from the same original video frame. Each is a distinct detection.
    *   Label images using categories like:
        *   "Crow" (good, single, clear crow)
        *   "Not Crow"
        *   "Unsure"
        *   "Multiple Crows" (important for exclusion from triplet training)
        *   "Bad Crow Image" (blurry, partial, etc.)
    *   These labels are saved to the database and are critical for later dataset preparation.
3.  **Review diligently.** The quality of your dataset heavily depends on this step.
    *   Images labeled as 'multi_crow', 'not_a_crow', or 'bad_crow' (and potentially others based on dataset loader configuration) will be automatically excluded from certain training datasets (like `ImprovedCrowTripletDataset`).

**Expected time:** 15-30 minutes for 1000 images.

### Phase 4: Model Training

#### Step 4: Setup Training
1.  **Close Image Reviewer and return to main GUI (if applicable).**
2.  **Open a command window and run:**
    ```bash
    python utilities/setup_improved_training.py --base-dir crow_crops
    # This script now uses --base-dir
    ```
3.  **Review the output:**
    *   The script analyzes the data (from `crop_metadata.json` and filtered by DB labels) in your `base_dir` (e.g., `crow_crops`).
    *   It recommends training parameters and creates `training_config.json`.
    *   The `training_config.json` will now use a `base_dir` key (e.g., value: "crow_crops") for the dataset loader.

#### Step 5: Start Training
1.  **In command window:**
    ```bash
    python train_improved.py --config training_config.json
    ```
    *   The `ImprovedCrowTripletDataset` (or similar used by `train_improved.py`) will load data using `crop_metadata.json` from the `base_dir` specified in the config. It will read images from the `videos/` subdirectory and automatically filter out images based on their database labels ('multi_crow', 'not_a_crow', 'bad_crow').

2. **Monitor progress:**
   - Training logs appear in the command window
   - Progress plots are saved to `training_output_improved/`
   - Checkpoints are saved every 10 epochs

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** 
- Keep the command window open during training
- Training can take 8-72 hours depending on your hardware
- You can safely use your computer for other tasks

### Phase 5: Validation and Analysis

#### Step 6: Evaluate Your Model
1.  **After training completes, run (note the updated arguments):**
    ```bash
    python utilities/simple_evaluate.py --model-path training_output/your_model_timestamp/best_model.pth --base-dir crow_crops --id-similarity-threshold 0.5 --non-crow-similarity-threshold 0.4
    ```
    *(Adjust model path and thresholds as needed)*

2.  **Review the results:**
    *   The script now uses `crop_metadata.json` and DB labels from the `--base-dir` to load evaluation samples, including 'crow' and 'not_a_crow' images.
    *   **Crow Identification Metrics**:
        *   `precision_id`, `recall_id`, `f1_id`, `accuracy_id`: Performance on distinguishing between known crow IDs.
        *   `avg_similarity_pos_id`, `avg_similarity_neg_id`, `separability_id`: Analyze similarity scores for same vs. different known crows.
    *   **Crow vs. Non-Crow Distinction Metrics**:
        *   `non_crow_true_rejection_rate`: Percentage of 'not_a_crow' images correctly identified as not matching any known crow (below `--non-crow-similarity-threshold`).
        *   `non_crow_false_alarm_rate`: Percentage of 'not_a_crow' images incorrectly flagged as similar to a known crow.
    *   A good model will have high values for ID precision/recall/F1, good separability for ID, a high non-crow true rejection rate, and a low non-crow false alarm rate.

#### Step 7: Advanced Quality Control
1. **From main Facebeak GUI:**
   - Click **"Launch Suspect Lineup"** to manually verify identifications
   - Click **"Run Clustering"** to find potential duplicate IDs

2. **In Suspect Lineup:**
   - Review suggested crow identifications
   - Confirm or reject each suggestion
   - Split crows that were incorrectly merged

### Phase 6: Deploy and Test

#### Step 8: Process New Videos
1. **In main Facebeak GUI:**
   - Click **"Add Videos"** to select new video files
   - Adjust detection thresholds if needed:
     - **Detection Threshold:** 0.3 (lower = more sensitive)
     - **YOLO Threshold:** 0.2
     - **IOU Threshold:** 0.2 (lower = more lenient tracking)
   - Set **Output Directory** to where you want results
   - Click **"Process Videos"**

2. **Monitor processing:**
   - Progress appears in the output window
   - Processing time depends on video length and settings
   - Results are saved to your specified output directory

**Expected time:** 10-30 minutes per hour of video
