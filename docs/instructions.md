# Project Overview

facebeak is a crow identification and labeling tool. It processes videos to find birds, track them across time, and optionally identify unique crow vocalizations.

## Goals

- Detect crows in outdoor videos using pretrained computer vision models.
- Assign visual embeddings and match individuals over time.
- Support UV and audio analysis in future versions.

## Stack

- Python
- TorchVision (Faster R-CNN, ResNet)
- OpenCV
- Librosa (planned)
