- Use ResNet18 (with identity head) to compute 128x1 embeddings of crow crops.
- Use Euclidean distance to compare embeddings and assign consistent IDs across frames.
- Avoid reassigning new IDs unless distance exceeds the configurable threshold.
- Designed for quick iteration and model swapping later.
